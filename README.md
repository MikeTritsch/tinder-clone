## Description

My last group project for the University of Texas Full Stack Coding Bootcamp revolved around creating a "dating-app" for movie/show lovers. During this time, we experienmented with various methods to have users be able to like or dislike (seen as "want to watch" or "don't want to watch") a piece of media. I began obsessing over how dating apps like Tinder or Hinge use their algorithims to allow users to match with each other. I found this tutorial by the wonderful Ania Kubow on YouTube and followed along. In addition to learning more about matching systems, I also used this an opportunity to practice my skills in React.

**THIS WILL NOT BE A DEPLOYED APPLICATION FOR THE TIME BEING**

## What comes next? and other issues...

The final step in this tutorial is cleaning up all of the various console.logs throughout the codebase. I learned a lot about building a full stack application using React, more specifically how to effectively set up routes. Although I followed a tutorial, I found myself prediciting the next steps as the tutorial went on.

I also learned more about useState and it's importance in React, specifically how vital it is to frontend development.

I plan on referencing this codebase for future work on my personal projects, including my other repository called "Watch Togethr".
